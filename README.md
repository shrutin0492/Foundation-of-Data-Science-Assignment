# Foundation of Data Science Assignment

This repository contains programs included in the assignment completed as part of the Foundation of Data Science course in the 2nd year of my undergrad. 

The assignments are implemented in a single Colab notebook named `fds_assignment.ipynb`.

The notebook contains the following programs:

1. **Sentiment Analysis - Airline Reviews:** This program performs sentiment analysis on airline reviews. It classifies the sentiment of the reviews as positive, negative, or neutral using natural language processing techniques.

2. **Weather Prediction (ARIMA):** This program utilizes the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to predict weather patterns. It analyzes historical weather data to forecast future weather conditions.

3. **Stock Market Prediction:** This program focuses on predicting stock market trends. It employs data analysis and machine learning techniques to make predictions about future stock prices.
